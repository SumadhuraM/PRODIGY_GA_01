# PROGIDY_GA_03 - Task 3

## Overview
Markov Chain Text Generation – Task 3.  
This project implements a **Markov Chain-based text generation model** that predicts the next word(s) based on the previous word(s) and generates text according to patterns in the input file.

## Files
- `task_backup.ipynb` – The main notebook containing the implementation and outputs.  
- `sample.txt` – Input text file used for training the model.

## How to Run
1. Open `task_backup.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook.  
2. Make sure `sample.txt` is in the same folder.  
3. Run the cells sequentially to see the generated text.

## Notes
- The model demonstrates **basic predictive text generation** using Markov chains.  
- Only Task 3 files are included in this repository.
